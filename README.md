# The Sweet Sap

_Good things come in pairs_ The backend uses `express`/`sequelize` and the frontend uses `react`/`redux`.

## Setup

* Create two postgres databases

```
createdb sweet-sap
createdb sweet-sap-test
```

* Run databases

```
npm run seed
```

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`. From there, just follow your bliss.
